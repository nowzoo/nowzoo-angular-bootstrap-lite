# Angular Bootstrap Lite

This library is an Angular wrapper for those Bootstrap components that
add and subtract elements from the DOM:

- Modals
- Tooltips
- Popovers

<strong>Important: depends on Bootstrap, Tether and slim jQuery.</strong>
Rather than recreating Bootstrap components from scratch in native Angular, we
use Bootstrap javascript and its dependencies.This is a fundamentally different
approach from other Angular/Bootstrap libraries. Namely, it's not "pure" Angular.
We've went for a bit of impurity for the sake of a smaller codebase and consistency with Bootstrap.

(Want Angular purity? Look here https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap or here https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap.)

## Design Philosophy: SoNoMoCo
**Sow** **No** **Mo**re **Co**nfusion ...than strictly necessary.

Bootstrap works. Angular works. We're just here to make it easier to integrate native Bootstrap js  into your Angular project.
